## Kaggle Machine Learning Challenges

###### A home for attempts at Kaggle Machine Learning Challenges. Including challenge details and links to datasets.

### [Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
This one is pretty famous - the disaster and the challenge. At the time of writing this is an ongoing competition. You can submit your results to see how
you fair against other individuals/teams.

The competition is simple - predict the likelihood that a passenger survived based on the available data.

Get the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

You can go deep tweaking. The scores on the leaderboard are pretty impressive, but if you're new to ML and just want a good challenge to start with, then this is worth a look. In my included effort I've used XGBoost, but any decision tree classification model will work. It's worth trying a few then tweaking those hyperparameters to get it as close as you can to perfection.
